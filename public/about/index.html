In a literal sense, Expiscor means to &ldquo;fish out&rdquo;, and figuratively, to find out, to discover, to learn. My life has always been driven by curiosity. It hasn&rsquo;t been a straightforward path, but it has yielded fruitful and unique life experience. Expiscor is how I share my investigations and findings with you.

<p>My life went through several different adventures, and the latest journey is called &ldquo;AI Engineer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the space, I focus on AI solutions with a product mind. I strive for quality software, but also am pragmatic and not bogged down by &ldquo;perfectionism&rdquo;. You can find out what I know about the space in my socials or through my posts.</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m known as the guy that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances engineering and machine learning rigours in LLM prototypes, and take them to production</li>
<li>Bridges the gap between technology and business</li>
<li>Learns a wide range of subject matter knowledge even just for fun</li>
<li>Where to eat or drink in Toronto</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past, I actually started out as an eSport analyst for League of Legend, which is why I didn&rsquo;t go to college. Once that avenue ran up, I pivoted to freelance as Market Research Analyst to build stories out of numbers, and created pitch decks for startups.</p>
<p>I was always fascinated by data. More specifically, the human stories that can and cannot be told through data. It&rsquo;s why I pivoted to machine learning, and after today&rsquo;s LLM revolution, AI engineering.</p>

</h1>
<p>I have a small consulting firm called ARC. I get asked about implementation for AI products, especially for LLM use and RAG. But I like coding and system architecture more than just simple chats, so this is a convenient way to help both of us.</p>
