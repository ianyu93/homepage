# What is Expiscor?
In a literal sense, Expiscor means to "fish out", and figuratively, to find out, to discover, to learn. My life has always been driven by curiosity. It hasn't been a straightforward path, but it has yielded fruitful and unique life experience. Expiscor is how I share my investigations and findings with you.

# Who am I?
My life went through several different adventures, and the latest journey is called "AI Engineer".

In the space, I focus on AI solutions with a product mind. I strive for quality software, but also am pragmatic and not bogged down by "perfectionism". You can find out what I know about the space in my socials or through my posts.

Currently, I'm known as the guy that:
- Balances engineering and machine learning rigours in LLM prototypes, and take them to production
- Bridges the gap between technology and business
- Learns a wide range of subject matter knowledge even just for fun
- Where to eat or drink in Toronto

In the past, I actually started out as an eSport analyst for League of Legend, which is why I didn't go to college. Once that avenue ran up, I pivoted to freelance as Market Research Analyst to build stories out of numbers, and created pitch decks for startups. 

I was always fascinated by data. More specifically, the human stories that can and cannot be told through data. It's why I pivoted to machine learning, and after today's LLM revolution, AI engineering.

# What is ARC?
I have a small consulting firm called ARC. I get asked about implementation for AI products, especially for LLM use and RAG. But I like coding and system architecture more than just simple chats, so this is a convenient way to help both of us.
